# Real Estate Edge — Static Magazine Template

Files included:
- index.html — main page
- styles.css — styling and responsive layout
- script.js — small client-side behaviors
- assets/ — (create this folder) put any images or video here:
  - assets/hero-video.mp4 (recommended)
  - assets/hero-poster.jpg (poster image shown before video plays)

How to run:
1. Place the files in a folder, create an `assets/` folder as above and add your hero video (MP4) and poster image.
2. Open `index.html` in a browser (Chrome/Edge/Firefox).
3. Customize copy and images as needed.

Notes & customization tips:
- Fonts use Google Fonts (Playfair Display for headings, Montserrat for body). Change them in the <head> of index.html to try different looks.
- Header is explicitly set to 20px, body to 14px, and disclaimer fineprint to 8px to match your specification.
- The subscribe form is client-only. Hook it up to any email provider (Mailchimp, ConvertKit, etc.) by replacing the form action or adding an AJAX request.
- Links to playlist and YouTube are included in the sidebar (playlist: https://coffeebarconnoisseur.com/, YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@designrenovate).

Accessibility:
- Basic semantic markup and labels are included.
- The play button toggles video play/pause but is intentionally simple for broad device compatibility.

If you'd like:
- I can add CSS animations, a sticky header, or convert the subscribe form to post to a service.
- I can prepare a production build (minified CSS/JS) or setup a small static site deployment (GitHub Pages) with instructions.
