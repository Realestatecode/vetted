      <p class="lede">Today, we’re diving into debt yields and how they’re shaking up asset pricing in this higher-interest-rate environment. If you’ve been watching cap rates and Treasury yields, buckle up: we’re about to break down why the spread has narrowed to levels we haven’t seen since 2006...</p>

      <h5>Not all asset classes are created equal</h5>
      <p>Industrial and multifamily properties continue to exhibit strong demand fundamentals, while office and retail sectors face structural headwinds that may necessitate higher cap rate adjustments to offset risk.</p>

      <h5>Retail Sector Fallout</h5>
      <p>Westfield Culver City reports a 22% drop in lease commitments year-over-year. Major anchor tenants — including Macy's and Nordstrom — have not renewed.</p>

      <h5>Industrial Properties Facing Recession Shock</h5>
      <p>Near LAX and Vernon, logistics facilities tied to tariff-impacted goods have seen growing vacancy rates. A large distribution center previously leased by a Chinese import firm defaulted on its lease obligations.</p>

      <p class="closing">We specialize in identifying and stabilizing properties, maximizing both operational efficiency and investor returns. Our Value Proposition includes expertise in generational real estate, stabilization to maximize yield, and a proven track record.</p>
